## Next Chat App
I created this app to gain some familiarity with NextJS and sockets. It's a simple chat app that allows you to chat with everyone else in the site. It's not very secure, or even very practical, but it was a fun project to work on.  
The site is currently deployed at https://next-js-chat-app.herokuapp.com/, but I'll be taking it down when Heroku stops offering free hosting :)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
